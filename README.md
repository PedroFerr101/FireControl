# FireControl
Operations Research project in OPL

This project concerns the need to protect an area of forest from a possible fire starting there. To better use the resources, we
developed a model in OPL to calculate in which of forest's cells to put defending agents to delay the spreading of the flames.
The requirements are described in Portuguese in the file "enunciado". A report was also made in Portuguese, where we
discuss the results of our model and what are the best ways to fight the fire.
